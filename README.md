# visualizeMe
A web app designed to give you a graphical representation of your MyFitnessPal data 
## Motivation
I had become increasingly frustrated with the graphical visuals used by my MyFitnessPal I wanted to be able to have access to all forms of charts to see my data from different perspectives. 
I also wanted to be able to predict my future calorie intake to be able to see when I go over or under my calories. 

## Build status
Currently functional  but requiring updates to use Travis CI.

## Screenshots
Will be adding GIFs to display data.
